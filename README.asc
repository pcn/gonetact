== Make your mutt contacts go away

A daemon to talk to google to allow you to use your google contacts from
within mutt.

Proudly helping to keep you in the pre-web 0.0 days, by enhancing your
antiquated neckbeard email client.

== OAuth2 based

Register yourself with google to use their oauth2 api
from your very own private console (which could be your laptop)

== How it works

The interface to it will be command-line based, similar to
abook, goobook, etc.

The workflow will be:
* execute
** if there is a token that exists on disk already
   in ~/.gonetact/client.json, use it.
*** Connect to google's auth API and do the oauth2 dance to get contacts API access
*** Provide commands to:
**** Get all contacts
**** add a contact (deletes will be up to the web UI for now)
*** Log all changes locally, though another in-account location would be cool
** if not then:
*** determine the hostname via either:
**** .gonetactrc
**** failing the config file, hostname := os.Hostname()
*** put an http server on a listening socket
*** display a URL to go to which will then ask you to auth to google.
*** get the oauth token
*** save it to ~/.gonetact-token

== TODO:

* Write up a better intro to how to get your google API to allow you to do alias updates
* Write a section on how to configure mutt
* Look at other similar clients to see if they have a convention in the contacts where they
  store lookup info for aliases.
* currently read-only. May not need writes, I don't know.
